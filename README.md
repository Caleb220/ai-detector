# AI Detector Project

## Overview

This repository contains a simple web application that estimates how likely a
piece of text was generated by AI. The detector consists of two parts:

- **Backend** – A [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) service that
  analyses text with Shannon entropy and basic word statistics.
- **Frontend** – A small React app that lets users paste text and view the
  resulting score.

## Project Structure

```
backend/      FastAPI service with analysis logic
frontend/app  React application
```

## Getting Started

### Backend

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server.main:app --reload
```

The API exposes `POST /analyse` and returns an AI likelihood score and
explanation.

### Frontend

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
cd frontend/app
npm install
npm start
```

This launches the React development server at `http://localhost:3000`, which
sends requests to the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyse`.

## Running Tests

### Backend

```bash
pytest backend/server
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend/app
CI=true npm test
```

## API Example

```
POST /analyse
{
  "text": "This is a test."
}

{
  "ai_score": 42.0,
  "explanation": "Entropy=2.56, Avg word length=4.00, Std dev=1.41"
}
```
